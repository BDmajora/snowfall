# Snowfall — YetiOS Login Manager

A minimal, DRM-native graphical login manager for YetiOS.

## Architecture

Snowfall is a framebuffer login manager that renders directly to
DRM/KMS (no X11, no Wayland compositor required). It authenticates
users via PAM, then execs the selected session as the authenticated
user. When no session files are installed, snowfall falls back to a
built-in default — on YetiOS, CrystallineLattice (`glacier-phase0`).

```
snowfall (DRM master)
  ├── drm.c          KMS/DRM framebuffer setup
  ├── input.c        libinput keyboard handling
  ├── renderer.c     Cairo-based UI drawing
  ├── auth.c         PAM authentication
  ├── session.c      Session discovery + launch
  ├── ui_state.c     UI state machine (field focus, navigation)
  └── main.c         Lifecycle: init → render loop → auth → exec
```

When snowfall starts, it grabs DRM master (which causes snowcone to
exit). After successful authentication it drops DRM master, switches
to the user's VT, and execs the compositor.

## Dependencies

- libdrm
- libinput + libudev
- cairo
- libpam
- libxkbcommon (keymap handling)

### Alpine / YetiOS

```sh
apk add libdrm-dev libinput-dev cairo-dev linux-pam-dev libxkbcommon-dev eudev-dev
```

## Build

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

## OpenRC

```sh
sudo rc-update add snowfall default
```

The service depends on `udev` (for libinput) and starts after
`snowcone` (the boot splash). When snowfall grabs DRM master,
snowcone detects the loss and exits.

## Session files

Snowfall reads `.desktop` files from `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/`.
Each file must have an `Exec=` line. Example:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Sway
Exec=sway
Type=Application
```

If the directory is empty or absent, snowfall offers a built-in default
session that launches **CrystallineLattice** (`glacier-phase0`), YetiOS's
from-scratch DRM/KMS layer. Override it by dropping a `.desktop` file here,
or change `SF_DEFAULT_EXEC` in [`src/session.c`](src/session.c).
